                           C02 OS Scheduler Alpha
                            For 6500-class CPUs


The C02 kernel was started on 11/22/2004, inspired by the minikernel by
Joachim Deboy.  His minikernel does not assemble on A6 and has sparse
documentation and comments; it is also hard-coded to support four tasks.
I have long dreamed of writing my own OS, if only for fun, and a somewhat
extensible "kernel" would be a great place for any OS to start.  Linus
Torvalds himself began Linux as a tiny, simple task switcher with two
processes, and this kernel is no different...yet anyway.

OBJECTIVES
----------

* Extensibility at all phases of development
* Retain low task-switching imposed latency
* Support a reasonable number of tasks
* EXTREMELY WELL COMMENTED CODE IS A MUST!
* Stability and speed

From the beginning, the kernel is a heavily-commented piece of software.
I had one hell of a time figuring out some of the simplest things about
OS development and if any newbies read my code, they will be able to read
and understand everything that the code is supposed to do, provided they
have already learned 6502 assembly and understand how the registers and
instructions work.

Any bugfixes or improvements are welcome.

This source code is hereby released into the public domain.  Do what you
will with it.  Future releases may or may not be public domain.  It is
entirely up to whoever releases them!

Official releases will ALWAYS be directly from me (Jody Bruchon).

Enjoy it!

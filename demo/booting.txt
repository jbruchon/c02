BOOTING THE DEMO KERNEL
-----------------------

Note that this document is C64-centric, but the general guidelines still
apply to other systems.

As primitive as it is now, with no device drivers or filesystem, the kernel
cannot load programs itself.  You must load the programs you wish to use
into the appropriate init task memory locations specified in the source you
have built.  A file called "qstart" is provided with the kernel that will
disable interrupts, remove ROMs from Commodore 64 memory, and start the
kernel at $ff00.  Also, "boot.prg" contains loaders for the scheduler,
task1, task2, and writes "qstart" at 8192.  SYS 8192 will start the demo.

The kernel's default task locations are $1000 and $7000.  Load any old
assembly program into these before you jump-start the kernel.  Included
are programs "task1" and "task2" that write "A" and "B" to the screen,
respectively, using $0300-$0301 as the "cursor location" and performing
a bounds check at $07e7 (the default end of video memory on the C64).

If you want this thing to work better for you, write your own programs to
run under it! :)

Happy multitasking,
Jody

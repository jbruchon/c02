                    Syslib:  C02 System Function Library
                      ===============================

This file is part of the C02 OS API documentation.

SYSLIB DESCRIPTION

Syslib is the C02 OS core system library.  It provides re-entrant system
calls that provide a common interface across different platforms and drivers.
Syslib's provided services and features include:

* Number-based device I/O
* Common key input queue service
* Re-entrant code including mutex protection
* Locked resources do not make programs sleep, allowing maximum control
  over potential deadlock or resource-hog problems by the programmer

SYSLIB-PROVIDED SYSTEM CALLS

NAME:  getchar
USES:  A X P
USAGE:  Load X with the character device number to access.  If carry bit is
        clear, A contains the next character from the device.  If carry bit
        is set, A contains the device error number.

NAME:  putchar
USES:  A X Y P
USAGE:  Load X with the character device number to access.  Load A with the
        character to send to the device.  If carry bit is clear, the write
        was successful.  If carry bit is set, A contains the device error
        number.

NAME:  queuekey
USES:  A X P
USAGE:  Load A with the byte to add to the system's keyboard queue.  If the
        keyboard queue is full, carry will be set and A will contain the
        error code 3 (the only valid error code for this operation).  This
        call is used primarily by keyboard drivers, but is useful if you
        want to force a key into the keyboard queue for some reason.

NAME:  criticalsection
USES:  A
USAGE:  Calling this will disable task switches but leaves IRQ/NMI servicing
        hooks functional.  If you must disable IRQs, do so very sparingly and
        before you call this function.

NAME:  uncriticalsection
USES:  A
USAGE:  Calling this will enable task switches.  This is the reverse of
        calling criticalsection.  If you disable interrupts in your program,
        you should enable them after calling this function to ensure proper
        system operation.

NAME:  multiply8
USES:  A X Y P
USAGE:  Place the 8-bit unsigned number to be multiplied in Y, and place the
        multiplier in X.  Call this routine.  The 16-bit result will be
        placed in X/Y with X containing the high byte and Y containing the
        low byte.

                           C02 Operating System
                           For 65xxx-class CPUs


The C02 kernel was started on 11/22/2004.

I have long dreamed of writing my own OS, if only for fun, and a somewhat
extensible "kernel" would be a great place for any OS to start.  Linus
Torvalds himself began Linux as a tiny, simple task switcher with two
processes.

OBJECTIVES
----------

* Extensibility at all phases of development
* Retain low task-switching imposed latency
* Support a reasonable number of tasks
* EXTREMELY WELL COMMENTED CODE IS A MUST!
* Stability and speed

From the beginning, the kernel is a heavily-commented piece of software.
I had one hell of a time figuring out some of the simplest things about
OS development and if any newbies read my code, they will be able to read
and understand everything that the code is supposed to do, provided they
have already learned 6502 assembly and understand how the registers and
instructions work.

Any bugfixes or improvements are welcome.

Official releases will ALWAYS be directly from me (Jody Bruchon).

One more thing:  This code is Copyright (C) 2004, 2005 by Jody Bruchon.
If you want to do something with it that is not strictly for personal use,
please contact me directly.  I like public domain stuff, but if I am going
to spend time developing an OS, I intend to protect my hard work from being
negatively exploited.

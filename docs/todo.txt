C02 Operating System TODO List
------------------------------

* Terminal types will be needed in the far future; for now, the specifics
  of each "dumb terminal" driver are hard-coded.

* Merge block move calls into one common block move call that will determine
  the proper direction and recalculate vectors as needed for the operation.

C02 Operating System TODO List
------------------------------

Some of this might be more of a wish list, really.

* Terminal types will be needed in the far future; for now, the specifics
  of each "dumb terminal" driver are hard-coded.

* Merge block move calls into one common block move call that will determine
  the proper direction and recalculate vectors as needed for the operation.

* Finish up VIC-II driver.

* Create options that allow modularization of Syslib and the kernel; also,
  make alternate kernel core components (i.e. a memory-saving scheduler
  and a normal scheduler) that will help when building for extremely low
  memory systems or allow the builder to make more choices about such things
  as size/space tradeoffs.

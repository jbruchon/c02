C02 Operating System TODO List
------------------------------

Some of this might be more of a wish list, really.

* Terminal types will be needed in the far future; for now, the specifics
  of each "dumb terminal" driver are hard-coded.

* Merge block move calls into one common block move call that will determine
  the proper direction and recalculate vectors as needed for the operation.

* Block moves currently increment the vector instead of using indexing.  This
  makes block moves slower, but it works for now, so it's a low priority to
  change it.

* Finish up VIC-II driver.

* Create a 1541/71/81 asynchronous fast-load disk driver.

* Need to build my own development tools.  I don't like the O65 format.  I
  need dynamic linking in the kernel, and once that is done, I may be able
  to modularize the drivers.  It's required to load programs too.

* Create options that allow modularization of Syslib and the kernel; also,
  make alternate kernel core components (i.e. a memory-saving scheduler
  and a normal scheduler) that will help when building for extremely low
  memory systems or allow the builder to make more choices about such things
  as size/space tradeoffs.

* Implement a proper NES PPU driver and NMI handler.  Perhaps a page could
  be reserved as a PPU update FIFO and then dumped on NMI.  Needs work.

* Banked memory and 65816 extension management and handling would be great.
  Banking data will become part of a task context, as will ZP and stack
  page data.  This will take advantage of advanced features offered by these
  enhanced 6502 platforms.

Started initial work on kernel code


11/25/2004  Jody Bruchon (jbruchon@nc.rr.com)

Completed basic kernel scheduler with C64-specific IRQ handling.  Entire scheduler with init routines fits in ~186 bytes! :)
Now we need device drivers... :(

12/28/2004  Jody Bruchon (jbruchon@nc.rr.com)

Scheduler now has an offset cache instead of loops.  Code down to 163 bytes total, *89 bytes for the scheduler!*  Cycle count is now 156 cycles per context switch (+3 if looping back to task 1).  This count does not change with higher quantities of running tasks.

12/30/2004  Jody Bruchon (jbruchon@nc.rr.com)

Completed initial rebuild for ACME assembler.  Split scheduler into sub-arch folders
and now use a file "build.cfg" to define how to construct the source for the target.
Used stack instructions instead of zero page stores to save two bytes in "irqload"
in 6502/sched/irq.s and 65c02/sched/irq.s.  Optimized sched.s parts for 65c02 CPU.
